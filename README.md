Written by Ben Koshy. Probably the most valuable and useful Tekla Plugin out there.

What does it do?

It allows the user to create multi drawings, which contains THE SAME profiles (of beams, flatbars etc) with lengths of ASCENDING order, in the one place.

In the model view - it selects all the pieces with the same profiles. If a drawing already exists for a particular member (i.e. a flat bar) then it is not selected - because a drawing already exists for it.

The benefit of this is that you can see what parts are not standard parts. And you can highlight errors like no tomorrow. Any questions - please ask. I don't remember much about writing it, but i'll do my best.

In other words it makes life a lot easier for fabricators: (i) All the information on one place, (ii) Less shuffling around. 

Normally it is quite a nightmare.
