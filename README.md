# TeklaPlugin--BenKoshy-s--MultiDrawingSelector
Written by Ben Koshy. Probably the most valuable and useful Tekla Plugin out there. Written by Ben Koshy: ben.k@tek1.com.au

**What does it do?**

It allows the user to create multi drawings, which contain THE SAME profiles (of beams, flatbars etc) with lengths of ASCENDING order, in the one place.

In the model view - it selects all the pieces with the same profiles. If a drawing already exists for a particular member (i.e. a flat bar) then it is not selected - because a drawing already exists for it.

**So what, who cares?**

The benefit of this is that you can see what parts are not standard parts.  You want to use standard flat bar sizes as much as possible. This checks whether it's all kosher. And if not, you'l see that you're using a non-standard flatbar. Nothing annoys a client more than being forced to make a custom flatbar when a standard one will do.

And you can highlight errors in your models like no tomorrow.

Any questions - please ask. I don't remember much about writing it, but i'll do my best.

The second benefit is that instead of having 7 drawings, you can now have only one. 

In other words it makes life a lot easier for fabricators: (i) All the information on one place, (ii) Less shuffling around. 

Normally it is quite a nightmare.
