Probably my most important and valuable Tekal Plugin.

What does it do?

It allows the user to create multi drawings, which contains THE SAME profiles (of beams, flatbars etc) with lengths of ASCENDING order.

In other words it makes life a lot easier for fabricators: (i) All the information on one place, (ii) Less shuffling around. 

Normally it is quite a nightmare.
